- **Data Tables**: Sortable, paginated tables for large datasets

## Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Flask, SQLAlchemy, Flask-CORS
- **Frontend**: React 18, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Lucide icons
- **Database**: SQLite (development), easily upgradeable to PostgreSQL
- **Build Tools**: Vite, pnpm

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/drivers/search?driver_id={id}` - Search drivers
- `GET /api/drivers/{id}/incentives` - Get incentive history
- `GET /api/drivers/{id}/bans` - Get ban history
- `GET /api/drivers/{id}/bans/active` - Get active bans
- `GET /api/drivers/{id}/stats` - Get performance statistics

## Sample Data

The application includes comprehensive sample data:

### Sample Drivers
- **DRV001** (John Smith): High performer, 73.33% achievement rate
- **DRV002** (Sarah Johnson): Average performer with past ban history
- **DRV003** (Mike Chen): Currently banned with high fraud activity
- **DRV004** (Emily Davis): Good performer, consistent achiever
- **DRV005** (Robert Wilson): Inactive driver with poor performance

### Data Features
- 30 days of incentive records per driver
- Realistic fraud patterns and detection
- Active and expired ban records
- Performance variations by driver type
